# Housing Price Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project for predicting house sale prices in a northwestern county. The project involves exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and building regression models to predict house prices. The analysis was carried out using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.


## Project Overview

For this project, I will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a Northwestern county.

### The Data

The dataset used in this project is the King County House Sales dataset from GitHub which I forked and cloned. The dataset contains information about house sales in King County, Washington, between May 2014 and May 2015.


### Business Problem

The business problem related to analyzing house sales in a northwestern county using regression modeling is accurately predicting house sale prices. This is a crucial issue for various stakeholders involved in the real estate industry, including real estate agents, homebuyers, investors etc.
The Shareholder that we will focus on will be homebuyers, this notebook will analyze the dataset in order to help them make informed and better decisions to purchase a home.

### Analysis
The analysis carried out in this project includes the following steps:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis: This involves examining the distribution of the target variable and the relationships between the target and the feature variables.

2.Data Cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the features.

3.Regression Modeling: This involves building and evaluating regression models, including linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of the King County House Sales dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices in the northwestern county. The results of the analysis can be used by homebuyers, real estate agents, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about buying or selling properties in the area.
